> I went out at night alone;<br>
> The young blood flowing beyond the sea<br>
> Seemed to have drenched my spirit's wings —<br>
> I bore my sorrow heavily.
>
> But when I lifted up my head<br>
> From shadows shaken on the snow,<br>
> I saw Orion in the east<br>
> Burn steadily as long ago.
>
> — from "Winter Stars" by Sara Teasdale

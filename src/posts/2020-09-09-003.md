> "Early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat, only thou and I, and never a soul in the world would know of this our pilgrimage to no country and to no end. In that shoreless ocean, at thy silently listening smile my songs would swell in melodies, free as waves, free from all bondage of words. Is the time not come yet? Are there works still to do? Lo, the evening has come down upon the shore and in the fading light the seabirds come flying to their nests. Who knows when the chains will be off, and the boat, like the last glimmer of sunset, vanish into the night?"

Well, this one took much longer than expected as well! I'm learning to let go of (or at least relax my grip on) any particular creative vision for an episode and to try to find a vision contained within the pieces available to me. I kept trying to make this episode go one way, but then I couldn't find pieces to fit that vision. Oh, well. I'm happy with how it turned out, though!

I'm sorry that the audio quality is a little poorer on a couple of the recordings — but it can't be helped since I've limited myself to using only resources that are in the public domain.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy it!
